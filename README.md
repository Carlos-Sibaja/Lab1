# Lab Work: Data Analytics with Streamlit

## Overview
This project is part of the CSIS 4260 â€“ Special Topics in Data Analytics course. The application is built using Streamlit and focuses on benchmarking different data processing techniques and predicting stock prices.

## Features
- **Benchmark CSV vs Parquet**: Compare the performance of CSV and Parquet file formats in terms of size and processing time.
- **Benchmark Pandas vs Polars**: Evaluate the performance of Pandas and Polars libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predict future stock prices using machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest.
